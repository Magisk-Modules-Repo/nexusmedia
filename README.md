### Description
Custom ROMs usually don't include Google system media, instead including numerous less-than-desirable sounds/visuals. This installs media from old Nexus devices systemlessly (SuperSU and Magisk support), or to system with an addon.d script to survive a ROM update or dirty flash.

Contains hammerhead, flo/deb, shamu, volantis/g, bullhead and angler media. Please read the [release post](https://bit.do/nexmed) for more info about bootanimation support, media choice, zip renaming options and special features.

### Notes
Magisk module version is populated at flash time by the chosen media's device name
