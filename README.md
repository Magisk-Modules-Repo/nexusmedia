### Description
Custom ROMs usually don't include Google system media, and instead use many less-than-desirable sounds/visuals. This installs media from Nexus devices systemlessly (via SuperSU/Magisk), or to system with an addon.d script for ROM updates/flashes.

Contains Nexus 5, 5X, 6, 6P, 7 (2013) and 9 media. Please read the [release post](https://xdaforums.com/t/tools-zips-scripts-osm0sis-odds-and-ends-multiple-devices-platforms.2239421/post-69978402) for info re: bootanimation support, media choice, zip renaming options and special features.

*Note:* Magisk module version is populated at flash time by the chosen media's device name
